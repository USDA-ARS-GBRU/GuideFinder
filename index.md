CRISPR-Cas systems have expanded the possibilities for gene editing in bacteria and eukaryotes. There are many excellent tools for designing the CRISPR-Cas guide RNAs for model organisms with standard Cas enzymes. GuideMaker is intended as a fast and easy-to-use design tool for atypical projects with: 1) non-standard Cas enzymes, 2) non-model organisms, or 3) projects that need to design a panel of guide RNAs (gRNA) for genome-wide screens.

GuideMaker can rapidly design gRNAs for gene targets across the genome from a degenerate protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and a GenBank file . The tool applies Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs to speed up the comparison of guide RNAs enabling the user to design gRNAs for all genes for a typical bacterial genome and PAM sequence in about 1-2 minutes on a laptop.

Guidemaker enables the rapid design of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas gene function studies in non-model organisms with any Cas enzyme. While GuideMaker is designed with prokaryotic genomes in mind, it can process smaller eukaryotic genomes as well. GuideMaker is available as command-line software and as a [web application](https://guidemaker.app.scinet.usda.gov) at **https://guidemaker.app.scinet.usda.gov** and in the **[CyCverse Discovery Environment](https://cyverse.org/discovery-environment)**.
